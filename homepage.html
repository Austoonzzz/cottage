    <p>Welcome everyone! My name is Austin and this website is made to showcase what goes on at our cottage. Here are a couple of things to expect while exploring the website:</p>
    <h3>Blogging</h3>
    <p>Sometimes we just have a bunch of stuff to talk about! This will most likely be random, fun and silly stuff that we talk about during our time up there. </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>Things that we want to see at the cottage in the future, but it'll take some time to get these things. This will go in the Goals section.</p>
    <h3>Photos</h3>
    <p>If you ever want to just know what's there at the property or things that are near it, it'll be posted in this section.</p>
